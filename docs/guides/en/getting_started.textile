h2. Getting Started with Akelos

This guide covers getting up and running with Akelos. After reading it, you should be familiar with:

* Installing Akelos, creating a new Akelos application, and connecting your application to a database
* The general layout of an Akelos application
* The basic principles of MVC (Model, View Controller) and RESTful design
* How to quickly generate the starting pieces of an Akelos application.

WARNING. This Guide is based on Akelos 2.0. Some of the code shown here will not work in other versions of Akelos.

h3. This Guide Assumes

This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with an Akelos application from scratch. It does not assume that you have any prior experience with Akelos. However, to get the most out of it, you need to have some prerequisites installed:

* The "PHP":http://www.php.net/en/downloads language
* A working installation of "SQLite":http://www.sqlite.org (preferred), "MySQL":http://www.mysql.com, or "PostgreSQL":http://www.postgresql.org

It is highly recommended that you *familiarize yourself with PHP before diving into Akelos*. You will find it much easier to follow what's going on with an Akelos application if you understand basic PHP syntax. Akelos isn't going to magically revolutionize the way you write web applications if you have no experience with the language it uses. There are some good free resources on the internet for learning PHP, including:

* "PHP Simple tutorial":http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php
* "PHP Tutorial by W3Schools":http://www.w3schools.com/PHP/php_intro.asp

h3. What is Akelos ?

Akelos is a web development framework written in the PHP language. Many of its components and documentation have been ported from Ruby on Rails. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other frameworks. Akelos developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.

Akelos is opinionated software. That is, it assumes that there is a best way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that best way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn "The Akelos Way" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other frameworks to your Akelos development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.

The Akelos philosophy includes several guiding principles:

* DRY - "Don't Repeat Yourself" - suggests that writing the same code over and over again is a bad thing.
* Convention Over Configuration - means that Akelos makes assumptions about what you want to do and how you're going to do it, rather than letting you tweak every little thing through endless configuration files.
* REST is the best pattern for web applications - organizing your application around resources and standard HTTP is the fastest way to go.

h4. The MVC Architecture

Akelos is organized around the Model, View, Controller architecture, usually just called MVC. MVC benefits include:

* Isolation of business logic from the user interface
* Ease of keeping code DRY
* Making it clear where different types of code belong for easier maintenance

h5. Models

A model represents the information (data) of the application and the rules to manipulate that data. In the case of Akelos, models are primarily used for managing the rules of interaction with a corresponding database table. In most cases, one table in your database will correspond to one model in your application. The bulk of your application's business logic will be concentrated in the models.

h5. Views

Views represent the user interface of your application. In Akelos, views are often HTML files with embedded PHP code that perform tasks related solely to the presentation of the data. Views handle the job of providing data to the web browser or other tool that is used to make requests from your application.

h5. Controllers

Controllers provide the "glue" between models and views. In Akelos, controllers are responsible for processing the incoming requests from the web browser, interrogating the models for data, and passing that data on to the views for presentation.

h4. The Components of Akelos

Akelos provides a full stack of components for creating web applications, including:

* Action Controller
* Action View
* Active Record
* Action Mailer
* Active Resource
* Active Support

h5. Action Controller

Action Controller is the component that manages the controllers in an Akelos application. The Action Controller framework processes incoming requests to an Akelos application, extracts parameters, and dispatches them to the intended action. Services provided by Action Controller include session management, template rendering, and redirect management.

h5. Action View

Action View manages the views of your Akelos application. It can create both HTML and XML output by default. Action View manages rendering templates, including nested and partial templates, and includes built-in AJAX support.

h5. Active Record

Active Record is the base for the models in an Akelos application. It provides database independence, basic CRUD functionality, advanced finding capabilities, and the ability to relate models to one another, among other services.

h5. Action Mailer

Action Mailer is a framework for building e-mail services. You can use Action Mailer to send emails based on flexible templates, or to receive and process incoming email.

h5. Active Resource

Active Resource provides a framework for managing the connection between business objects and RESTful web services. It implements a way to map web-based resources to local objects with CRUD semantics.

h5. Active Support

Active Support is an extensive collection of utility classes and standard PHP library extensions that are used in the Akelos, both by the core code and by your applications.

h4. REST

The foundation of the RESTful architecture is generally considered to be Roy Fielding's doctoral thesis, "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures":http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm. Fortunately, you need not read this entire document to understand how REST works in Akelos. REST, an acronym for Representational State Transfer, boils down to two main principles for our purposes:

* Using resource identifiers (which, for the purposes of discussion, you can think of as URLs) to represent resources
* Transferring representations of the state of that resource between system components.

For example, to an Akelos application a request such as this:

<tt>DELETE /photos/17</tt>

would be understood to refer to a photo resource with the ID of 17, and to indicate a desired action - deleting that resource. REST is a natural style for the architecture of web applications, and Akelos makes it even more natural by using conventions to shield you from some of the RESTful complexities and browser quirks.

If you'd like more details on REST as an architectural style, these resources are more approachable than Fielding's thesis:

* "A Brief Introduction to REST":http://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction by Stefan Tilkov
* "An Introduction to REST":http://bitworking.org/news/373/An-Introduction-to-REST (video tutorial) by Joe Gregorio
* "Representational State Transfer":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer article in Wikipedia
* "How to GET a Cup of Coffee":http://www.infoq.com/articles/webber-rest-workflow by Jim Webber, Savas Parastatidis & Ian Robinson

h3. Creating a New Akelos Project

If you follow this guide, you'll create an Akelos project called <tt>blog</tt>, a (very) simple weblog. Before you can start building the application, you need to make sure that you have Akelos itself installed.

h4. Installing Akelos

In most cases, the easiest way to install Akelos is to unpack the Akelos tar.gz/zip file.

NOTE: If you want to keep up with cutting-edge changes to Akelos, you'll want to clone the "Akelos source code":http://github.com/akelos/akelos/tree/master from github. This is not recommended as an option for beginners, though.

h4. Creating the Blog Application

Open a terminal, navigate to the folder where you uncompressed Akelos and type:

<shell>
$ ./akelos /path/to/your/blog
</shell>

This will create an Akelos application.

TIP: You can see all of the switches that the Akelos application builder accepts by running <tt>./akelos -h</tt>.

After you create the blog application, switch to its folder to continue work directly in that application:

<shell>
$ cd /path/to/your/blog
</shell>

Now create the database configuration file by running:

<shell>
./script/configure 
</shell>

Alternatively you can edit config/config-DEFAULT.php

In any case, Akelos will create a folder <tt>blog</tt>. Open up that folder and explore its contents. Most of the work in this tutorial will happen in the <tt>app/</tt> folder, but here's a basic rundown on the function of each folder that Akelos creates in a new application by default:

|_. File/Folder |_. Purpose |
|README.textile|This is a brief instruction manual for your application. Use it to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on.|
|makefile.php|This file contains batch jobs that can be run from the terminal.|
|app/|Contains the controllers, models, and views for your application. You'll focus on this folder for the remainder of this guide.|
|config/|Configure your application's runtime rules, routes, database, and more.|
|doc/|In-depth documentation for your application.|
|lib/|Extended modules for your application (not covered in this guide).|
|log/|Application log files.|
|makelos|Makelos is a general-purpose command-runner that Akelos uses for many things. You can see the list of available makelos commands in your application by running +./makelos -T+.|
|public/|The only folder seen to the world as-is.  This is where your images, javascript, stylesheets (CSS), and other static files go.|
|scripts/|Script runners provided by Akelos to do recurring tasks, such as code generation, plugin installation, and starting the console or the web server.|
|test/|Unit tests, fixtures, and other test apparatus. These are covered in "Testing Akelos Applications":testing.html |
|tmp/|Temporary files|
|vendor/|A place for third-party code. In a typical Akelos application, this includes Akelos source code (if you install it into your project) and plugins containing additional prepackaged functionality.|

h4. Configuring a Database

Just about every Akelos application will interact with a database. The database to use is specified in a configuration file, +config/database.yml+.
If you open this file in a new Akelos application, you'll see the database configuration created by ./script/configure. The file contains sections for three different environments in which Akelos can run by default:

* The +development+ environment is used on your development computer as you interact manually with the application
* The +test+ environment is used to run automated tests
* The +production+ environment is used when you deploy your application for the world to use.

h5. Configuring a SQLite Database

Akelos comes with built-in support for "SQLite":http://www.sqlite.org, which is a lightweight server-less database application. While a busy production environment may overload SQLite, it works well for development and testing.

Here's the section of the default configuration file with connection information for the development environment:

<yaml>
development:
    type: sqlite
    database_file: db/database.sqlite
</yaml>

If you don't have any database set up, SQLite is the easiest to get installed.

h5. Configuring a MySQL Database

If you choose to use MySQL, your +config/database.yml+ will look a little different. Here's the development section:

<yaml>
development:
    type: mysql
    encoding: utf8
    host: localhost
    database_name: blog_development
    user: root
    password:
</yaml>

If your development computer's MySQL installation includes a root user with an empty password, this configuration should work for you. Otherwise, change the username and password in the +development+ section as appropriate.

h5. Configuring a PostgreSQL Database

If you choose to use PostgreSQL, your +config/database.yml+ will be customized to use PostgreSQL databases:

<yaml>
development:
    type: postgresql
    encoding: unicode
    host: localhost
    database_name: blog_development
    user: blog
    password:
</yaml>

Change the username and password in the +development+ section as appropriate.

h3. Hello, Akelos!

One of the traditional places to start with a new language is by getting some text up on screen quickly. To do that in Akelos, you need to create at minimum a controller and a view. Fortunately, you can do that in a single command. Enter this command in your terminal:

<shell>
$ ./makelos generate controller home index
</shell>

TIP: If you're on Windows, or your PHP is set up in some non-standard fashion, you may need to explicitly pass Akelos +makelos+ commands to PHP: +php makelos generate controller home index+.

Akelos will create several files for you, including +app/views/home/index.html.tpl+. This is the template that will be used to display the results of the +index+ action (method) in the +home+ controller. Open this file in your text editor and edit it to contains the following code:

<code class="html">
<h1>Home::index</h1>
<p><?php echo translate('Find me in %path',array('%path'=> 'app/views/home/index.html.tpl' ))?></p>
</code>

h4. Starting up the Web Server

You actually have a functional Akelos application already - after running only two commands! To see it, you need to start a web server on your development machine. You can do this by running another command:

<shell>
$ ./makelos server
</shell>

This will fire up an instance a simple PHP web server by default (Akelos can also use several other web servers). To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to +http://localhost:3000+. You should see Akelos' default information page:

!/images/akelos_welcome.png(Welcome Aboard screenshot)!

TIP: To stop the web server, hit Ctrl+C in the terminal window where it's running. Using the PHP server Akelos requires you to stop the server; changes you make in files will not be automatically picked up by the server when using script/server. You should setup Apache for reloading changed files.

The "Welcome Aboard" page is the _smoke test_ for a new Akelos application: it makes sure that you have your software configured correctly enough to serve a page. To view the page you just created, navigate to +http://localhost:3000/home/index+.

h4. Setting the Application Home Page

You'd probably like to replace the "Welcome Aboard" page with your own application's home page. The first step to doing this is to delete the default page from your application:

<shell>
$ rm public/index.html
</shell>

Now, you have to tell Akelos where your actual home page is located. Open the file +config/routes.php+ in your editor. This is your application's, _routing file_, which holds entries in a special DSL (domain-specific language) that tells Akelos how to connect incoming requests to controllers and actions. At the bottom of the file you'll see the _default routes_:

<php>
$Map->connect(':controller/:action/:id');
$Map->connect(':controller/:action/:id.:format');
</php>

The default routes handle simple requests such as +/home/index+: Akelos translates that into a call to the +index+ action in the +home+ controller. As another example, +/posts/edit/1+ would run the +edit+ action in the +posts+ controller with an +id+ of 1.

To hook up your home page, you need to add another line to the routing file, above the default routes:

<php>
$Map->root(array('controller' => 'home'));
</php>

This line illustrates one tiny bit of the "convention over configuration" approach: if you don't specify an action, Akelos assumes the +index+ action.

Now if you navigate to +http://localhost:3000+ in your browser, you'll see the +home/index+ view.

NOTE. For more information about routing, refer to "Akelos Routing from the Outside In":routing.html.

h3. Getting Up and Running Quickly with Scaffolding

Akelos _scaffolding_ is a quick way to generate some of the major pieces of an application. If you want to create the models, views, and controllers for a new resource in a single operation, scaffolding is the tool for the job.

h3. Creating a Resource

In the case of the blog application, you can start by generating a scaffolded Post resource: this will represent a single blog posting. To do this, enter this command in your terminal:

<shell>
$ ./makelos generate scaffold Post name,title,content
</shell>

NOTE. While scaffolding will get you up and running quickly, the "one size fits all" code that it generates is unlikely to be a perfect fit for your application. In most cases, you'll need to customize the generated code. Many experienced Akelos developers avoid scaffolding entirely, preferring to write all or most of their source code from scratch.

The scaffold generator will build 14 files in your application, along with some folders, and edit one more. Here's a quick overview of what it creates:

|_. File                                        |_. Purpose |
|app/models/post.php                            |The Post model|
|app/installers/post_installer.php              |Instaler for creating the posts table in your database|
|app/views/posts/index.html.tpl                 |A view to display an index of all posts |
|app/views/posts/show.html.tpl                  |A view to display a single post|
|app/views/posts/add.html.tpl                   |A view to create a new post|
|app/views/posts/edit.html.tpl                  |A view to edit an existing post|
|app/views/layouts/posts.html.tpl               |A view to control the overall look and feel of the other posts views|
|public/stylesheets/scaffold.css                |Cascading style sheet to make the scaffolded views look better|
|app/controllers/posts_controller.php           |The Posts controller|
|test/functional/posts_controller_test.php      |Functional testing harness for the posts controller|
|app/helpers/posts_helper.php                   |Helper functions to be used from the posts views|
|config/routes.php                              |Edited to include routing information for posts|
|test/fixtures/posts.yml                        |Dummy posts for use in testing|
|test/unit/post_test.php                        |Unit testing harness for the posts model|
|test/unit/helpers/posts_helper_test.php        |Unit testing harness for the posts helper|

h4. Running a Migration

One of the products of the +./makelos generate scaffold+ command is a _database migration_. Migrations are PHP classes that are designed to make it simple to create and modify database tables. Akelos uses makelos commands to run migrations, and it's possible to undo a migration after it's been applied to your database. Migration filenames include a timestamp to ensure that they're processed in the order that they were created.

If you look in the +db/migrate/20090113124235_create_posts.php+ file (remember, yours will have a slightly different name), here's what you'll find:

<php>
class PostInstaller extends AkInstaller {
  public function up_1(){
    $this->createTable('posts', 'name,title,content');
  }

  public function down_1(){
    $this->dropTable('posts');
  }
}
</php>

If you were to translate that into words, it says something like: when this migration is run, create a table named +posts+ with two string columns (+name+ and +title+) and a text column (+content+), and generate timestamp fields to track record creation and updating. You can learn the detailed syntax for migrations in the "Akelos Database Migrations":migrations.html guide.

At this point, you can use the installer script to run the migration:

<shell>
$ ./script/install
</shell>

NOTE. Because you're working in the development environment by default, this command will apply to the database defined in the +development+ section of your +config/database.yml+ file.

h4. Adding a Link

To hook the posts up to the home page you've already created, you can add a link to the home page. Open +app/views/home/index.html.tpl+ and modify it as follows:

<php>
<h1>Hello, Akelos!</h1>
<%= link_to "My Blog", posts_path %>
</php>

The +link_to+ method is one of Akelos' built-in view helpers. It creates a hyperlink based on text to display and where to go - in this case, to the path for posts.

h4. Working with Posts in the Browser

Now you're ready to start working with posts. To do that, navigate to +http://localhost:3000+ and then click the "My Blog" link:

!/images/posts_index.png(Posts Index screenshot)!

This is the result of Akelos rendering the +index+ view of your posts. There aren't currently any posts in the database, but if you click the +New Post+ link you can create one. After that, you'll find that you can edit posts, look at their details, or destroy them. All of the logic and HTML to handle this was built by the single +./makelos generate scaffold+ command.

TIP: In development mode (which is what you're working in by default), Akelos reloads your application with every browser request, so there's no need to stop and restart the web server.

Congratulations, you're now into akelos! Now it's time to see how it all works.

h4. The Model

The model file, +app/models/post.php+ is about as simple as it can get:

<php>
class Post extends ActiveRecord {
}
</php>

There isn't much to this file - but note that the +Post+ class inherits from +ActiveRecord+. Active Record supplies a great deal of functionality to your Akelos models for free, including basic database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) operations, data validation, as well as sophisticated search support and the ability to relate multiple models to one another.

h4. Adding Some Validation

Akelos includes methods to help you validate the data that you send to models. Open the +app/models/post.php+ file and edit it:

<php>
class Post extends ActiveRecord {
    public function validate(){
        $this->validatesPresenceOf(array('name', 'title'));
        $this->validatesLengthOf('title', array('minimum' => 5));
    }
}
</php>

These changes will ensure that all posts have a name and a title, and that the title is at least five characters long. Akelos can validate a variety of conditions in a model, including the presence or uniqueness of columns, their format, and the existence of associated objects.

h4. Using the Console

To see your validations in action, you can use the console. The console is a command-line tool that lets you execute PHP code in the context of your application:

<shell>
$ ./makelos console
</shell>

After the console loads, you can use it to work with your application's models:

<shell>
>> $p = Post::create(array('content' => "A new post"));
=> #<Post id: null, name: null, title: null, content: "A new post",
created_at: null, updated_at: null>
>> $p->save();
=> false
>> $p->getErrors();
=> #<ActiveRecord::Errors:0x23bcf0c @base=#<Post id: nil, name: nil,
title: nil, content: "A new post", created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>,
@errors={"name"=>["can't be blank"], "title"=>["can't be blank",
"is too short (minimum is 5 characters)"]}>
</shell>

This code shows creating a new +Post+ instance, attempting to save it and getting +false+ for a return value (indicating that the save failed), and inspecting the +errors+ of the post.

TIP: Unlike the development web server, the console does not automatically load your code afresh for each line. If you make changes to your models while the console is open, type +reload!+ at the console prompt to load them.

h4. Listing All Posts

The easiest place to start looking at functionality is with the code that lists all posts. Open the file +app/controllers/posts_controller.php + and look at the +index+ action:

<php>
public function index(){
  $this->posts = $this->Post->findAll();

  switch($this->respondTo()){
      case 'html': break;  // index.tpl.html
      case 'xml': $this->render(array('xml' => $this->posts));
  }
}
</php>

This code sets the +$this->posts+ instance variable to an array of all posts in the database. +$this->Post->find('all')+ or +$this->Post->findAll()+ calls the +Post+ model to return all of the posts that are currently in the database, with no limiting conditions.

TIP: For more information on finding records with Active Record, see "Active Record Query Interface":active_record_querying.html.

The +respondTo+ switch handles both HTML and XML calls to this action. If you browse to +http://localhost:3000/posts.xml+, you'll see all of the posts in XML format. The HTML format looks for a view in +app/views/posts/+ with a name that corresponds to the action name. Akelos makes all of the instance variables from the action available to the view. Here's +app/views/posts/index.html.tpl+:

<tpl>
<h1>Listing posts</h1>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Title</th>
    <th>Content</th>
  </tr>

{loop posts}
  <tr>
    <td><%=h post.name %></td>
    <td><%=h post.title %></td>
    <td><%=h post.content %></td>
    <td><%= link_to 'Show', post %></td>
    <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_post_path(post) %></td>
    <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', post, 'confirm' => 'Are you sure?',
            'method' => :delete %></td>
  </tr>
{end}
</table>

<br />

<%= link_to 'New post', new_post_path %>
</tpl>

This view iterates over the contents of the +$this->posts+ array to display content and links. A few things to note in the view:

* +h+ is an Akelos helper method to sanitize displayed data, preventing cross-site scripting attacks
* +link_to+ builds a hyperlink to a particular destination
* +edit_post_path+ is a helper that Akelos provides as part of RESTful routing. You'll see a variety of these helpers for the different actions that the controller includes.

TIP: For more details on the rendering process, see "Layouts and Rendering in Akelos":layouts_and_rendering.html.

h4. Customizing the Layout

The view is only part of the story of how HTML is displayed in your web browser. Akelos also has the concept of +layouts+, which are containers for views. When Akelos renders a view to the browser, it does so by putting the view's HTML into a layout's HTML. The +./makelos generate scaffold+ command automatically created a default layout, +app/views/layouts/posts.html.tpl+, for the posts. Open this layout in your editor and modify the +body+ tag:

<tpl>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
       "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="content-type"
        content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" />
  <title>Posts: <%= controller.action_name %></title>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'scaffold' %>
</head>
<body style="background: #EEEEEE;">

<%= flash %>

{content_for_layout}

</body>
</html>
</tpl>

Now when you refresh the +/posts+ page, you'll see a gray background to the page. This same gray background will be used throughout all the views for posts.

h4. Creating New Posts

Creating a new post involves two actions. The first is the +add+ action, which instantiates an empty +Post+ object:

<php>
public function add(){
  $this->post = new Post();

  switch($this->respondTo()){
      case 'html': break;  // add.tpl.html
      case 'xml': $this->render(array('xml' => $this->post));
  }
}
</php>

The +add.html.tpl+ view displays this empty Post to the user:

<tpl>
<h1>New post</h1>

<% f = form_for(post); %>
  <?= $f->error_messages(); ?>

  <p>
    <?= $f->label('name'); ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_field('name'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->label('title'); ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_field('title'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->label('content'); ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_area('content'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->submit("Create"); ?>
  </p>
</form>

<%= link_to 'Back', posts_path %>
</tpl>

The +form_for+ returns an object used to create an HTML form. Within this object, you have access to methods to build various controls on the form. For example, +f.text_field :name+ tells Akelos to create a text input on the form, and to hook it up to the +name+ attribute of the instance being displayed. You can only use these methods with attributes of the model that the form is based on (in this case +name+, +title+, and +content+). Akelos uses +form_for+ in preference to having you write raw HTML because the code is more succinct, and because it explicitly ties the form to a particular model instance.

TIP: If you need to create an HTML form that displays arbitrary fields, not tied to a model, you should use the +form_tag+ method, which provides shortcuts for building forms that are not necessarily tied to a model instance.

When the user clicks the +Create+ button on this form, the browser will send information back to the +create+ method of the controller (Akelos knows to call the +create+ method because the form is sent with an HTTP POST request; that's one of the conventions we mentioned earlier):

<php>
public function create(){
  $this->post = new Post($this->params['post']);
  if($this->post->save()){
      $this->flash['notice'] = $this->t('Post was successfully created.');
      switch($this->respondTo()){
          case 'html': $this->redirectTo($this->post); break;
          case 'xml': $this->render(array('xml' => $this->post, 
                                          'status' => 'created',
                                          'location' => $this->post ));
      }
  }else{
      switch($this->respondTo()){
          case 'html': $this->renderAction('add'); break;
          case 'xml': $this->render(array('xml' => $this->post->getErrors(),
                                          'status' => 'unprocessable_entity'));
      }
  }
}
</php>

The +create+ action instantiates a new Post object from the data supplied by the user on the form, which Akelos makes available in the +params+ array. After saving the new post, it uses +flash['notice']+ to create an informational message for the user, and redirects to the show action for the post. If there's any problem, the +create+ action just shows the +add+ view a second time, with any error messages.

Akelos provides the +flash+ array (usually just called the Flash) so that messages can be carried over to another action, providing the user with useful information on the status of their request. In the case of +create+, the user never actually sees any page rendered during the Post creation process, because it immediately redirects to the new Post as soon Akelos saves the record. The Flash carries over a message to the next action, so that when the user is redirected back to the +show+ action, they are presented with a message saying "Post was successfully created."

h4. Showing an Individual Post

When you click the +show+ link for a post on the index page, it will bring you to a URL like +http://localhost:3000/posts/1+. Akelos interprets this as a call to the +show+ action for the resource, and passes in +1+ as the +'id'+ parameter. Here's the +show+ action:

<php>
public function show(){
  $this->post = $this->Post->find($this->params['id']);

  switch($this->respondTo()){
      case 'html': break; // show.tpl.html
      case 'xml': $this->render(array('xml' => $this->posts));
  }
}
</php>

The +show+ action uses +$this->Post->find+ to search for a single record in the database by its id value. After finding the record, Akelos displays it by using +show.html.tpl+:

<tpl>
<p>
  <b>_{Name}:</b>
  <%=h post.name %>
</p>

<p>
  <b>_{Title}:</b>
  <%=h post.title %>
</p>

<p>
  <b>_{Content}:</b>
  <%=h post.content %>
</p>


<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_post_path(post) %> |
<%= link_to 'Back', posts_path %>
</tpl>

h4. Editing Posts

Like creating a new post, editing a post is a two-part process. The first step is a request to +edit_post_path(post)+ with a particular post. This calls the +edit+ action in the controller:

<php>
public function edit(){
  $this->post = $this->Post->find($this->params['id']);
}
</php>

After finding the requested post, Akelos uses the +edit.html.tpl+ view to display it:

<tpl>
<h1>_{Editing post}</h1>

<% f = form_for(post); %>
  <?= $f->error_messages(); ?>

  <p>
    <?= $f->label('name'); ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_field('name'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->label('title') ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_field('title') ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->label('content')?><br />
    <?= $f->text_area('content'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->submit("Update"); ?>
  </p>
</form>

<%= link_to 'Show', post %> |
<%= link_to 'Back', posts_path %>
</tpl>

Submitting the form created by this view will invoke the +update+ action within the controller:

<php>
public function update(){
    $this->post = $this->Post->find($this->params['id']);

    if($this->post->updateAttributes($this->params['post'])){
        $this->flash['notice'] = $this->t('Post was successfully updated.');
        switch($this->respondTo()){
            case 'html': $this->redirectTo($this->post); break;
            case 'xml' : $this->head('ok');
        }
    }else{
        switch($this->respondTo()){
            case 'html': $this->renderAction('edit'); break;
            case 'xml' : $this->render(array('xml' => $this->post->getErrors(),
            'status' => 'unprocessable_entity'));
        }
    }
}
</php>

In the +update+ action, Akelos first uses the +'id'+ parameter passed back from the edit view to locate the database record that's being edited. The +update_attributes+ call then takes the rest of the parameters from the request and applies them to this record. If all goes well, the user is redirected to the post's +show+ view. If there are any problems, it's back to +edit+ to correct them.

NOTE. Sharp-eyed readers will have noticed that the +form_for+ declaration is identical for the +add+ and +edit+ views. Akelos generates different code for the two forms because it's smart enough to notice that in the one case it's being passed a new record that has never been saved, and in the other case an existing record that has already been saved to the database. In a production Akelos application, you would ordinarily eliminate this duplication by moving identical code to a _partial template_, which you could then include in both parent templates. But the scaffold generator tries not to make too many assumptions, and generates code that's easy to modify if you want different forms for +create+ and +edit+.

h4. Destroying a Post

Finally, clicking one of the +destroy+ links sends the associated id to the +destroy+ action:

<php>
public function destroy(){
    $this->post = $this->Post->find($this->params['id']);
    $this->post->destroy();

    switch($this->respondTo()){
        case 'html': $this->redirectTo(posts_url()); break;
        case 'xml' : $this->head('ok');
    }
}
</php>

The +destroy+ method of an Active Record model instance removes the corresponding record from the database. After that's done, there isn't any record to display, so Akelos redirects the user's browser to the index view for the model.

h3. DRYing up the Code

At this point, it's worth looking at some of the tools that Akelos provides to eliminate duplication in your code. In particular, you can use _partials_ to clean up duplication in views and _filters_ to help with duplication in controllers.

h4. Using Partials to Eliminate View Duplication

As you saw earlier, the scaffold-generated views for the +add+ and +edit+ actions are largely identical. You can pull the shared code out into a partial template. This requires editing the new and edit views, and adding a new template. The new +_form.html.tpl+ template should be saved in the same +app/views/posts+ folder as the files from which it is being extracted. Note that the name of this file begins with an underscore; that's the Akelos naming convention for partial templates.

<tt>add.html.tpl</tt>:

<tpl>
<h1>_{New post}</h1>

<%= render 'partial' => 'form' %>

<%= link_to 'Back', posts_path %>
</tpl>

<tt>edit.html.tpl</tt>:

<tpl>
<h1>_{Editing post}</h1>

<%= render 'partial' => 'form' %>

<%= link_to 'Show', post %> |
<%= link_to 'Back', posts_path %>
</tpl>

<tt>_form.html.tpl</tt>:

<tpl>
<% f = form_for(post) %>
  <?= $f->error_messages(); ?>

  <p>
    <?= $f->label('name'); ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_field('name'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->label('title', 'title'); ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_field('title'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->label('content'); ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_area('content'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->submit("Save"); ?>
  </p>
</form>
</tpl>

Now, when Akelos renders the +new+ or +edit+ view, it will insert the +_form+ partial at the indicated point. Note the naming convention for partials: if you refer to a partial named +form+ inside of a view, the corresponding file is +_form.html.tpl+, with a leading underscore.

For more information on partials, refer to the "Layouts and Rendering in Akelos":layouts_and_rendering.html#using-partials guide.

h4. Using Filters to Eliminate Controller Duplication

At this point, if you look at the controller for posts, you'll see some duplication:

<php>
class PostsController extends ApplicationController {
    # ...
    public function show() {
        $this->post = $this->Post->find($this->params['id']);
        # ...
    }

    public function edit() {
        $this->post = $this->Post->find($this->params['id']);
    }

    public function update() {
        $this->post = $this->Post->find($this->params['id']);
        # ...
    }

    public function destroy() {
        $this->post = $this->Post->find($this->params['id']);
        # ...
    }
}
</php>

Four instances of the exact same line of code doesn't seem very DRY. Akelos provides _filters_ as a way to address this sort of repeated code. In this case, you can DRY things up by using a +before_filter+:

<php>
class PostsController extends ApplicationController{
    public function __construct(){
        $this->beforeFilter('_findPost', array('only' => array('show','edit','update','destroy')));
    }
    # ...
    public function show() {
        # ...
    }

    public function edit() {
    }

    public function update() {
        # ...
    }

    public function destroy() {
        # ...
    }

    public function _findPost() {
        $this->post = $this->Post->find($this->params['id']);
    }
}
</php>

Akelos runs _before filters_ before any action in the controller. You can use the +'only'+ clause to limit a before filter to only certain actions, or an +'except'+ clause to specifically skip a before filter for certain actions. Akelos also allows you to define _after filters_ that run after processing an action, as well as _around filters_ that surround the processing of actions. Filters can also be defined in external classes to make it easy to share them between controllers.

Filters need to be declared public, but we will use Akelos conventions to prevent users from calling the method by underscoring it.

For more information on filters, see the "Action Controller Overview":action_controller_overview.html guide.

h3. Adding a Second Model

Now that you've seen what's in a model built with scaffolding, it's time to add a second model to the application. The second model will handle comments on blog posts.

h4. Generating a Model

Models in Akelos use a singular name, and their corresponding database tables use a plural name. For the model to hold comments, the convention is to use the name Comment. Even if you don't want to use the entire apparatus set up by scaffolding, most Akelos developers still use generators to make things like models and controllers. To create the new model, run this command in your terminal:

<shell>
$ ./makelos generate model Comment commenter,body,post_id
</shell>

This command will generate four files:

* +app/models/comment.php+ - The model
* +app/installers/comment_installer_.php+ - The installer
* +test/unit/comment_test.php+ and +test/fixtures/comments.yml+ - The test harness.

First, take a look at +comment.php+:

<php>
class Comment extends ActiveRecord {
  public $belongs_to = array('post');
}
</php>

This is very similar to the +post.php+ model that you saw earlier. The difference is the line +public $belongs_to = array('post');+, which sets up an Active Record _association_. You'll learn a little about associations in the next section of this guide.

In addition to the model, Akelos has also made a migration to create the corresponding database table:

<php>
class CreateComments extends AkInstaller {
    public function up_1(){
        $this->createTable('comments', 'commenter,body,post_id');
    }

    public function down_1(){
        $this->dropTable('comments');
    }
}
</php>

The +post_id+ fields sets up a foreign key column for the association between the two models. Go ahead and run the installer:

<shell>
$ ./script/install
</shell>

Akelos is smart enough to only execute the migrations that have not already been run against the current database.

h4. Associating Models

Active Record associations let you easily declare the relationship between two models. In the case of comments and posts, you could write out the relationships this way:

* Each comment belongs to one post
* One post can have many comments

In fact, this is very close to the syntax that Akelos uses to declare this association. You've already seen the line of code inside the Comment model that makes each comment belong to a Post:

<php>
class Comment extends ActiveRecord {
  public $belongs_to = array('post');
}
</php>

You'll need to edit the +post.php+ file to add the other side of the association:

<php>
class Post extends ActiveRecord {
    public $has_many = array('comments');
    public function validate(){
        $this->validatesPresenceOf(array('name', 'title'));
        $this->validatesLengthOf('title', array('minimum' => 5));
    }
}
</php>

These two declarations enable a good bit of automatic behavior. For example, if you have an instance variable +post+ containing a post, you can retrieve all the comments belonging to that post as the array +post->comments+.

TIP: For more information on Active Record associations, see the "Active Record Associations":association_basics.html guide.

h4. Adding a Route

_Routes_ are entries in the +config/routes.php+ file that tell Akelos how to match incoming HTTP requests to controller actions. Open up that file and find the existing line referring to +posts+ (it will be right at the top of the file). Then edit it as follows:

<php>
$Map->resources('posts', array('has_many' => 'comments'));
</php>

This creates +comments+ as a _nested resource_ within +posts+. This is another part of capturing the hierarchical relationship that exists between posts and comments.

TIP: For more information on routing, see the "Akelos Routing from the Outside In":routing.html guide.

h4. Generating a Controller

With the model in hand, you can turn your attention to creating a matching controller. Again, there's a generator for this:

<shell>
$ ./makelos generate controller Comments index show add edit
</shell>

This creates eight files:

* +app/controllers/comments_controller.php+ - The controller
* +app/helpers/comments_helper.php+ - A view helper file
* +app/views/comments/index.html.tpl+ - The view for the index action
* +app/views/comments/show.html.tpl+ - The view for the show action
* +app/views/comments/add.html.tpl+ - The view for the add action
* +app/views/comments/edit.html.tpl+ - The view for the edit action
* +test/functional/comments_controller_test.php+ - The functional tests for the controller
* +test/unit/helpers/comments_helper_test.php+ - The unit tests for the helper

The controller will be generated with empty methods and views for each action that you specified in the call to +./makelos generate controller+:

<php>
class CommentsController extends ApplicationController {
    public function index() {
    }

    public function show() {
    }

    public function add(){
    }

    public function edit() {
    }
}
</php>

You'll need to flesh this out with code to actually process requests appropriately in each method. Here's a version that (for simplicity's sake) only responds to requests that require HTML:

<php>
class CommentsController extends ApplicationController {

    public function __construct(){
        $this->beforeFilter('_findPost', array('only' => array('show','edit','update','destroy'));
    }

    public function index() {
        $this->comments = $this->post->comments;
    }

    public function show() {
        $this->comment = $this->post->comments->find($this->params['id']);
    }

    public function add(){
        $this->comment = $this->post->comments->build();
    }

    public function create() {
        $this->comment = $this->post->comments->build($this->params['comment']);
        if($this->comment->save()){
            $this->redirectTo( post_comment_url($this->post, $this->comment) );
        }else{
            $this->renderAction('add');
        }
    }

    public function edit() {
        $this->comment = $this->post->comments->find($this->params['id']);
    }

    public function update() {
        $this->comment = $this->Comment->find($this->params['id']);
        if($this->comment->updateAttributes($this->params['comment'])){
            $this->redirectTo( post_comment_url($this->post, $this->comment) );
        }else{
            $this->renderAction('edit');
        }
    }

    public function destroy() {
        $this->comment = Comment.find($this->params['id']);
        $this->comment->destroy();
        $this->redirectTo( post_comments_path($this->post) );
    }

    public function _findPost() {
        $this->post = $this->Post->find($this->params['post_id']);
    }

}
</php>

You'll see a bit more complexity here than you did in the controller for posts. That's a side-effect of the nesting that you've set up; each request for a comment has to keep track of the post to which the comment is attached.

In addition, the code takes advantage of some of the methods available for an association. For example, in the +add+ method, it calls

<php>
$this->comment = $this->post->comments->build();
</php>

This creates a new +Comment+ object _and_ sets up the +post_id+ field to have the +id+ from the specified +Post+ object in a single operation.

h4. Building Views

Because you skipped scaffolding, you'll need to build views for comments "by hand". Invoking +./makelos generate controller+ will give you skeleton views, but they'll be devoid of actual content. Here's a first pass at fleshing out the comment views.

The +views/comments/index.html.tpl+ view:

<tpl>
<h1>_{Comments for %post.title}</h1>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>_{Commenter}</th>
    <th>_{Body}</th>
  </tr>

{loop comments}
  <tr>
    <td>{\comment.commenter}</td>
    <td>{\comment.body}</td>
    <td><%= link_to 'Show', post_comment_path(post, comment) %></td>
    <td>
        <%= link_to 'Edit', edit_post_comment_path(post, comment) %>
    </td>
    <td>
        <%= link_to 'Destroy', post_comment_path(post, comment),
            'confirm' => 'Are you sure?', 'method' => :delete %>
    </td>
  </tr>
{end}
</table>

<br />

<%= link_to 'New comment', new_post_comment_path(post) %>
<%= link_to 'Back to Post', post %>
</tpl>

The +views/comments/add.html.tpl+ view:

<tpl>
<h1>_{New comment}</h1>

<% f = form_for([post, comment]) %>
  <?= $f->error_messages(); ?>

  <p>
    <?= $f->label('commenter'); ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_field('commenter'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->label('body'); ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_area('body'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->submit("Create"); ?>
  </p>
</form>

<%= link_to 'Back', post_comments_path(post) %>
</tpl>

The +views/comments/show.html.tpl+ view:

<tpl>
<h1>_{Comment on %post.title}</h1>

<p>
  <b>_{Commenter}:</b>
  {\comment.commenter}
</p>

<p>
  <b>_{Comment}:</b>
  {\comment.body}
</p>

<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_post_comment_path(post,comment) %> |
<%= link_to 'Back', post_comments_path(post) %>
</tpl>

The +views/comments/edit.html.tpl+ view:

<tpl>
<h1>_{Editing comment}</h1>

<% f = form_for([post, comment]) %>
  <?= $f->error_messages(); ?>

  <p>
    <?= $f->label('commenter'); ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_field('commenter'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->label('body'); ?><br />
    <?= $f->text_area('body'); ?>
  </p>
  <p>
    <?= $f->submit("Update"); ?>
  </p>
</form>

<%= link_to 'Show', post_comment_path(post, comment) %> |
<%= link_to 'Back', post_comments_path(post) %>
</tpl>

Again, the added complexity here (compared to the views you saw for managing posts) comes from the necessity of juggling a post and its comments at the same time.

h4. Hooking Comments to Posts

As a next step, I'll modify the +views/posts/show.html.tpl+ view to show the comments on that post, and to allow managing those comments:

<tpl>
<p>
  <b>_{Name}:</b>
  {\post.name}
</p>

<p>
  <b>_{Title}:</b>
  {\post.title}
</p>

<p>
  <b>_{Content}:</b>
  {\post.content}
</p>

<h2>_{Comments}</h2>
{loop comments}
  <p>
    <b>_{Commenter}:</b>
    {\comment.commenter}
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>_{Comment}:</b>
    {\comment.body}
  </p>
{end}

<%= link_to 'Edit Post', edit_post_path(post) %> |
<%= link_to 'Back to Posts', posts_path %> |
<%= link_to 'Manage Comments', post_comments_path(post) %>
</tpl>

Note that each post has its own individual comments collection, accessible as +$this->post->comments+. That's a consequence of the declarative associations in the models. Path helpers such as +post_comments_path+ come from the nested route declaration in +config/routes.php+.

h4. Deleting Associated Objects

If you decide at some point to delete a post, you likely want to delete the comments associated with that post as well. You can do so by taking advantage of the association option +dependent+. All you need to do is modify the +post.php+ as follows:

<php>
class Post extends ActiveRecord {
    public $has_many = array('comments' => array('dependent' => 'destroy'));
    public function validate(){
        $this->validatesPresenceOf(array('name', 'title'));
        $this->validatesLengthOf('title', array('minimum' => 5));
    }
}
</php> 

h3. What's next?
